# ZOOMIT
In this COVID time, we are back home, our daily routines went online, from work to social meating, to workouts and conferences. Most of these activities take place on Zoom. But how do you share your meetings to others? how are they registered? Everyone does it in a different way, Some share a post on Facebook pages, some write a message in Telegram groups, etc. We find it very frustrating that there is no one place that collects all Zoom events together. In Zoomit that's exactly what we're going to solve. Zoomit is a user-friendly platform that collects Zoom events from all over the internet (like  Telegram, Facebook, websites, etc.) using smart crawlers and bots, and saves them into one dynamic repository. This repository can be accessed via a web platform that allows users create and add new events, search and register to events according to their interests. So next time you have free time, come to Zoomit and find your zoom event.
